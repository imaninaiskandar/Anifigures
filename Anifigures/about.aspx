        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>A combination of the words "anime" and "figures". We specialise in selling figures of your beloved characters for your collection! 
           But don't let our name fool you; we also have figures of video game characters and other Japanese media. We are a Brunei-based shop and 
           we get our goods directly from Japan!</p>
    
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Anifigures was founded in 2015, and was formed to bring happiness and the thrill of figures to our fellow otakus in Brunei! We have our branch located at Batu Satu, 
           and we have been serving customers since then. Our online store launched in May 2017 and we hope to continue to help our customers' collections grow.</p>
    
        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to bringing customers original and quality goods at a reasonable price. 
           Worry not, we are completely against counterfeits and bootlegs, so you will not be seeing that nonesense here.</p>
